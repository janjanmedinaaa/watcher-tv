       This is a non-perfect workaround to achieve a ripple effect. The material library does not
       supply a drawable that can perform the ripple well. The final solution needs a custom
       Drawable to do the ripple effect.

       Because ripple by default applies half of the alpha of the color when focused, changed it to
       transparent while not pressed, when the user starts pressing the button then we animate the
       color. -->
